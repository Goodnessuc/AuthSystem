## Description

This repository contains a backend service developed in GoLang that handles user authentication and authorization.

It includes functionalities like user registration, login, password reset, social authentication (e.g., GitHub, Google),
and JWT authentication.

The service is designed with security in mind, implementing measures to prevent common attacks such as SQL injection,
CSRF attacks, and brute force attacks.
